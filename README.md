### Web Marketing

- Users:

As an e-commerce shop selling personalised baby products, the users of this website are likely to be parents, expecting parents, family members and friends of parents, or anyone looking for a unique and personalized gift for a newborn baby.

- Online platforms:

It is common for these types of e-commerce shops to find a lot of their users on popular online platforms such as search engines like Google, social media sites like Facebook and Instagram, and marketplaces like Amazon and eBay.

- Social media users:

Social media platforms can be effective for reaching and engaging with potential customers. The specific social media platforms that the users of this e-commerce shop might use can depend on various factors such as demographics, interests, and location. It is recommended for the e-commerce shop to conduct market research to identify the social media platforms that their target audience is most active on and develop a social media strategy to reach and engage with them.

- User's needs:

The users may need information about the products, their features, and usage guidelines. They may also need help with choosing the right product for their needs, as well as assistance with the ordering and delivery process.

One way to meet these needs is by providing high-quality product descriptions, including images and videos that showcase the products' features and benefits. Additionally, creating informative blog posts, tutorials, and frequently asked questions (FAQs) can help users make informed decisions and provide solutions to their problems.

To deliver this content to the users, the e-commerce shop could create a blog section on its website and share posts on social media platforms. The website could also have a prominent "Help" or "Support" section that provides information on frequently asked questions and ordering and delivery processes.

Email marketing campaigns could also be used to deliver useful content to users who have subscribed to the shop's mailing list. The emails could include product updates, promotions, and helpful tips and guides.

Overall, the key is to create content that is informative, engaging, and easy to understand, and to make it easily accessible to users through multiple channels.

- Running sales or offer discounts:

Running sales and offering discounts can be an effective way to attract and retain customers. To inform our users about these offers, we’ll consider using various marketing channels such as email marketing, social media, and pop-up notifications on our website. We’ll also offer exclusive discounts to subscribers of our email list or followers on social media platforms to encourage them to engage with our brand and stay updated on promotions.

- Business goals:

As an e-commerce business, the goals of this business include increasing sales, generating brand awareness, and building customer loyalty. Some marketing strategies that will help meet these goals include:

1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO): By optimizing the website's content and structure for search engines, the business can increase its visibility in search results and attract more traffic to the website.

2. Pay-Per-Click Advertising (PPC): Using platforms like Google Ads or Facebook Ads, the business can create targeted ads that reach potential customers based on their demographics, interests, and behaviours.

3. Social Media Marketing: By creating and sharing engaging content on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook, the business can build a following and connect with potential customers.

4. Email Marketing: By building an email list of subscribers and sending regular newsletters and promotions, the business can keep its brand top-of-mind and encourage repeat purchases.

5. Influencer Marketing: Partnering with influencers in the baby and parenting niche can help the business reach a wider audience and generate buzz around its products.

- Business budget:

It's possible that this business might need to work with free or low-cost options to market itself, especially if it has a limited marketing budget. There are many effective ways to market a business without spending a lot of money, such as social media marketing, email marketing, content marketing, influencer marketing, and search engine optimization (SEO). By focusing on these strategies and creating high-quality, engaging content that resonates with their target audience, this business can effectively market itself and grow its customer base without breaking the bank.

## Deployment

This project was deployed using

- Github - To store code and deploy the site.
- ElephantSql.com - To create an external database.
- Django and Heroku - To host the deployed project.
- Amazon AWS - To host the static and media files.

### GitHub

To create a new repository, I took the following steps:

1. Logged into GitHub.
2. Click the ‘repositories’ section.
3. Click the green ‘new’ button to create new repository.
4. Choose ‘repository template’ Used the code institute template as recommended from the dropdown menu.
5. Add repository name then clicked the green ‘create repository button’ at the bottom of the page.
6. Open the new repository and clicked the green ‘Gitpod’ button to create a workspace in Gitpod for editing.

### ElephantSql

Setting up ElephantSQL:

1. Access your ElephantSQL dashboard by logging in to ElephantSQL.com.
2. Click on "Create New Instance".
3. Set up your plan by giving it a name (usually the name of your project), selecting the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan, and leaving the Tags field blank.
4. Click on "Select Region" and then click on "Review".
5. Check your details and then click on "Create instance".
6. Go back to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the name of the database instance for your project.
7. To copy the database URL to your clipboard, click on the copy icon in the URL section.

### Django and Heroku

To set up the Django framework and configure the Heroku deployment, I followed these step-by-step instructions:

1. Installed Django framework and revisited the Walkthrough provided by Code institutes for assistance.
2. Logged into Heroku, went to the Dashboard and clicked on New to create a new app.
3. Gave the app a name, selected the region closest to me, and clicked Create app to confirm.
4. Opened the Settings tab and added the config var DATABASE_URL, and for the value, copied in the database URL from ElephantSQL.
5. Installed dj_database_url and psycopg2 in the terminal, both of which are required to connect to an external database.
6. Updated the requirements.txt file with the newly installed packages using pip freeze > requirements.txt.
7. Imported dj_database_url in the settings.py file and updated the DATABASES section with the new connection to the ElephantSQL database.
8. Ran the showmigrations command in the terminal to confirm the connection to the external database.
9. Migrated the database models to the new database using python3 manage.py migrate command.
10. Loaded in the fixtures in the correct order: categories first and then products.
11. Created a superuser for the new database using python3 manage.py createsuperuser command.
12. Deleted the database from the settings.py file to prevent exposing it when pushing to GitHub and reconnected to the local sqlite database.
13. Deployed the final version with DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ.

Note: For safety and security reasons, I generated a new Django secret key using a Django key generator and added it to both the env.py file and Heroku config vars. This ensured that even if the secret key had been pushed accidentally to GitHub, it would now be an invalid key.

### Amazon AWS

- #### Setting up Amazon AWS

To set up Amazon AWS, the following steps were taken (following the Code Institute walkthroughs to assist in setting up Amazon AWS):

1.  Log into Amazon AWS and signed in to the upper right by accessing the AWS management console under my account.
2.  Navigate to the Storage menu under All Services and clicked the link that says S3.
3.  Click the orange button that says 'Create Bucket'.
4.  Name the bucket and selected the closest region to me.
5.  Follow the [steps](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fullstack/AWS%20changes%20sheet.pdf) supplied by the Code Institute for Object Ownership.

- #### Connecting Django to S3

To connect Django to S3, the following steps were taken:

1.  Install the `Boto3` and `Django storages` packages by running the following commands:

    `pip3 install boto3`

    `pip3 install django-storages`

2.  Run the following command to save the installed packages to the `requirements.txt` file:

    `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

3.  Add 'storages' to the installed apps section inside the `settings.py` file.

4.  Add some additional settings to the same file to let Django know what bucket it's communicating with:
    - Near the bottom of the file, write an `if` statement to check if there is an environment variable called `USE_AWS` and add the following code inside:

```
if USE_AWS in os.environ:
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'insert-your-bucket-name-here'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'insert-your-region-here'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
```

5.  Add the following config vars in Heroku:
    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    - USE_AWS set to True
6.  Remove the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` variable in Heroku.
7.  Go to the `settings.py` file in my Django project and add the following line inside the `if` statement written earlier:

    `AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'`

8.  Create a custom_storages.py file and import my settings as well as the s3boto3 storage.
9.  Add the following two classes inside the `custom_storages.py` file:

```
class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
	location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
	location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```

10. In the `settings.py` file, underneath the bucket config settings but still inside the `if` statement, add the following lines:

```
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
```

11. Override and explicitly set the URLs for static and media files using my custom domain and new locations. Add the following two lines inside the same if statement:

```
STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```

12. After pushing the changes, the S3 bucket has a static folder with all the static files inside.

- #### Caching, Media Files & Stripe

To set up caching, media files, and Stripe, the following steps were taken:

1.  Open your `settings.py` file and add an `if` statement to handle media files caching. This allows static files to be cached for a long time and speeds up the loading of your site. Here's the code to add:

```
AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
    'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
    'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
}
```

2.  Save your changes to `settings.py`, then add, commit, and push your changes to Git.
3.  Log in to your Amazon AWS account and navigate to your S3 bucket. Create a new folder called "media" and save it.
4.  Inside the new "media" folder, click "Upload," "Add files," and select all of the images you're using on your site. Note that your media folder must match the media folder within your Workspace gitpod.io.
5.  Under "Permissions," select "Grant public-read access" and click Upload. You may also need to check an acknowledgement warning checkbox.
6.  With those steps completed, all of your static and media files should automatically link from Django to your S3 bucket.
7.  In the Django admin, confirm the email address for the superuser in the Postgres database. This is necessary for the user to log in to the store.
8.  Add your Stripe keys to the Heroku Config Vars.
9.  Sign in to your Stripe account and navigate to the "Developers" tab at the top right of the navbar.
10. Under "Developers," click "Webhooks," then "Add endpoint" in the side-nav.

11. On the next page, enter the link to your Heroku app followed by `/checkout/wh/`. It should look something like this:

`https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`

12. Click "+ Select events" and check the "Select all events" checkbox at the top. Then click "Add events" at the bottom to complete the form.

13. Your webhook is now created, and it should have generated a secret key. You'll need this to add to your Heroku config vars.

14. Navigate to your app in Heroku and go to the "Config Vars" section under settings. You'll need the secret key you generated for your webhook, as well as your publishable key and secret key that you can find in the API keys section in Stripe.

15. Add these values under these keys:

```
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'insert your stripe publishable key'
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = 'insert your secret key'
STRIPE_WH_SECRET = 'insert your webhooks secret key'
```

16. Finally, go back to your `settings.py` file in Django and insert the following near the bottom of the file:

```
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')
STRIPE_WH_SECRET = os.getenv('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '')
```

With these steps completed, you should be all set with caching, media files, and Stripe integration for your Django project.
